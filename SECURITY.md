Reporting a Vulnerability
-------------------------

In case of a vulnerability contact the maintainer of the project.

Vulnerabilities should be treated confidential during a period of at most 90 days.
This finishes earlier, if there is a fix made available.

This project has private reporting enabled, follow the instructions
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

Fixed vulnerabilities are to be included in the CHANGELOG and contain
also (if not otherwise requested) the name of the reporter of said vulnerability.
